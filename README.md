# memrise-bot
does your memrise hw for you if your too lazy!!!!!!!!!! (exe application version)

*how to use*
- download da zip
- extract da zip
- run the exe 
- put in ur username for memrise
- put in ur password for memrise (the program is ran localy so ur password is completely safe)
- put in the link of whichever memrise section you want to learn
- choose your browser (type "c" for chrome and "f" for firefox)
- choose if you want to run it headless or not (this means the chrome screen wont pop up and it will b less annoying
  if u dont want headless just press enter
- let the bot do its magic.

*how it works*
the bot essentially learns the words and appends them to a dictionary, so in order to do a memrise excersice it must learn 
the words first. after that it will answer them correctly except for some seeded randomness to make the bot a little less sus

*widows defender*
- windows might say the program is unsafe but i promise it safe, you can check the source code on my other git. Its made into an exe
using pyinstaller

*issues*
- sometimes the bot has trouble doing tapping questions if a "/" is present
